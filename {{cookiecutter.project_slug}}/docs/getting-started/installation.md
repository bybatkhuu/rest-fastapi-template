## 1. 📥 Download or clone the repository

**1.1.** Prepare projects directory (if not exists):

cd ~/workspaces/projects
```

**1.2.** Follow one of the below options **[A]**, **[B]** or **[C]**:

**OPTION A.** Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/{{cookiecutter.repo_owner}}/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}.git && \
    cd {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}
```

**OPTION B.** Clone the repository (for **DEVELOPMENT**: git + ssh key):

```sh
git clone git@github.com:{{cookiecutter.repo_owner}}/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}.git && \
    cd {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}
```

**OPTION C.** Download source code:

<!-- #### 3.1. Install base/common dependencies -->

```sh
pip install -r ./requirements.txt

# For DEVELOPMENT:
pip install -r ./requirements/requirements.dev.txt
# Install pre-commit hooks:
pre-commit install
```

Follow the one of below instructions based on your environment (A is recommended for most cases):

**OPTION A.** For Intel/AMD **x86_64** CPU:

```sh
pip install -r ./requirements/requirements.amd64.txt
```

**OPTION B.** For **arm64/aarch64** CPU:

```sh
